CDBUS GUI Tool
=======================================

CDBUS GUI is an open-source, cross-platform serial debugging tool supporting register read/write, waveform plotting, log printing, IAP upgrades, and more.

#### Download:
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/dukelec/cdbus_gui`


#### Dependence:
Python version >= 3.8  
`pip3 install pythoncrc json5 websockets pyserial u-msgpack-python aiohttp IntelHex`

#### Usage:
Run `main.py`, then open the following URL in your web browser: http://localhost:8910

The underlying protocol for serial port is CDBUS, which uses the following frame format:  
`src, dst, len, [payload], crc_l, crc_h`

Each frame includes a 3-byte header, a variable-length payload, and a 2-byte CRC (identical to Modbus CRC).  
For more information on the CDBUS protocol, please refer to:
 - https://cdbus.org

The payload is encoded using the CDNET protocol. For detailed information, please refer to:

### Index Page
 - "Serial": The first field accepts a port name or matching string (e.g., `ACM0`, `Bridge`, `2E3C:5740`), with wildcard support.  
   The second field is the baud rate, supporting arbitrary values.
 - "Available": Lists all serial ports on the computer.
 - "Devices": Quickly open the debug page for each device (list expands automatically).
 - "Logs": Aggregates logs from all devices.  
   (Pressing `Enter` inserts a blank line; Holding `Alt` or `Ctrl + Alt` allows block selection.)
 - Auto-reconnect supported for serial ports.
 - Modified settings are saved automatically.
 - Supports ANSI color codes.

### Device Page
 - Displays registers for reading and writing.
 - Hover over a register to view its description, type, and default value.
 - Registers are grouped for atomic R/W; groups can be edited freely.
 - `R` reads a group, `W` writes it. `Read All` / `Write All` act on all groups.
 - Supports arrays and multiple formats, displayed in hexadecimal (`H`) or as byte arrays (`B`).
 - Small notches on the `R`/`W` buttons indicate gaps; groups are read before writing so that the data in gaps remains unchanged.

#### Waveform Plots:
 - Supports real-time display and long data recording, including FFT visualization.
 - Supports multiple windows with adjustable sizes.
 - Mouse wheel with `Shift` or `Ctrl` scales the `X` or `Y` axis; by default, both axes scale together.
 - Touchscreen zoom and independent `X`/`Y` scaling are supported.
 - Double-click to reset the view (zoom to fit). Hold the left or middle mouse button to pan.
 - Individual channels can be toggled on or off for clarity.
 - Multiple plots can be started or stopped simultaneously via the `dbg_raw_msk` register.
 - Supports formula-based waveforms (e.g., `u_cal` below). Click `Re-Calc` to refresh the plot after modifying or adding formulas.

#### Picture Preview:
 - Preview images (e.g., JPEG files) sent from the device.

#### IAP and Data Import/Export:
 - IAP supports readback verification, device-side CRC validation, or no validation.
 - IAP supports Intel HEX files with multiple segments.
 - Register data, log outputs, and waveform data can be exported and imported together (in MessagePack format).


### JSON Format
 - The register list can be auto-generated by the MCU (printed when it powers up).
 - Uses JSON5 format, supporting hexadecimal values and comments.
 - The "fmt" string with "[]" is an array, which displays all data in one text box.
 - "{}" denotes struct arrays; each array element has its own text box containing multiple members of the struct.

**E.g.** `cdstep-v6.json`
```json5

```

 - "reg_r" and "reg_w" are the default register group configurations; you can leave them empty and edit via the UI (after editing, the browser debug window will print them; "less_r" and "less_w" work the same way).
 - The "fmt" of "plot" data corresponds to two packet formats:
   * "x1 a1 b1 a2 b2 …" – x-axis data is shared across groups. "H" denotes a uint16_t counter, incremented each loop; a number after "H" gives the delta to recover subsequent x values.
   * "x1 a1 b1 x2 a2 b2 …" – each data set has its own x value, suitable for variable loop periods.


### More Info
As a side note, `CDNET Address` refers to the IPv6 concept, allowing strings to represent different addresses, defined as follows.

```
/* CDNET Address string formats:
*
*            localhost      local link     unique local    multicast
*             10:00:00
* level0:                    00:NN:MM
* level1:                    80:NN:MM        a0:NN:MM       f0:MH:ML
*
* Notes:
*   NN: net_id, MM: mac_addr, MH/ML: multicast_id (H: high byte, L: low byte)
*/
```

 - Broadcast and multicast can also use the "link-local" format; the "multicast" format is generally not needed for simple cases.
 - "Unique local" is used only across network segments — for example, when multiple subnets each contain multiple devices.

Serial CDNET packets can be directly mapped to UDP packets, enabling multiple software applications to access the same serial device. Please refer to:
https://github.com/dukelec/cdnet_tun

To access a serial device via UDP, run the `main_udp.py` program instead.
